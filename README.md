# library-management-console-java

Welcome to the **Simple Library Management System**! This is a basic Java console application that allows you to manage books in a library with these core features:
- **Add a book** to the library
- **Issue (borrow) a book** if it is available
- **Return a book** back to the library
- **View all available books**

## How It Works
The program uses a menu-driven interface where you can:
1. Add a new book by entering its name.
2. Issue a book by specifying the book name. The system checks if the book is available before issuing.
3. Return a previously issued book.
4. See the list of all available books in the library.
You interact with the program via the console, and it keeps running until you decide to exit.
